        'p2' => '<b>You’ve found the place:</b> The digital collection of the Justo and Catherine González Resource Center, a program of the Asociación para la Educación Teológica Hispana. Here you will find an array of Dr. Justo L. González’s unpublished works such as sermons, Bible studies, and lectures as well as some of his published work, including Spanish-language Bible studies. Here you will also find many of the writings of Dr. Catherine G. González, one of the pioneering women in theological education, --some hers alone, and some in collaboration with Justo. These latter resources reveal so clearly how the Drs. Gonzálezes have collaborated and supported one another across the years.',
        'p3' => '   Over their more than sixty-year careers, the Drs. Gonzálezes have shared their thoughts, analysis, and interpretation on a wide range of topics that will inspire, inform, and challenge you: reading the Bible in new ways, encountering the witness of the early church, reforming theological education, and practicing justice. You will find all of that and much more coming to life here. So, browse, conduct targeted searches, read brief excerpts from the documents, learn from two of today’s important Christian leaders, and come back frequently as we are constantly uploading new resources.',
